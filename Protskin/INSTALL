	INSTALLATION :
	
ProtSkin was written with Python 2.3, so you need this language installed on your computer 
(see http://www.python.org/ for more information).
If needed, modify the first line of the script to find with your local python interpreter.

The main script is named ProtSkin and is located in the same directory as this INSTALL file.

You might want to create an alias for this script in the .cshrc file in your home directory.
For instance : 
	alias ProtSkin /usr/people/chris/software/ProtSkin-1.34/ProtSkin
