	NAME :
ProtSkin - protein visualization tool

	SYNOPSIS :
ProtSkin [-b -u -s -i -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7] filename [pdbfilename]

        DESCRIPTION :
ProtSkin is a protein visualization tool that create scripts for different programs to use with a PDB file.
The scripts allow the coloring of the protein surface or worm, colored and shaded using numerical
per residue values. Scripts for MOLMOL and PyMOL as generated, as well as a GRASP property file 
(containing one value per atom in the PDB file) and a pseudo-PDB file (where the temperature factor 
is replaced by the desired score) to use with programs such as InsightII.

ProtSkin can be used in 2 ways :
1) You can use ProtSkin to map any scalar data, such as heteronuclear NOE or chemical shift differences 
onto your protein structure. 
Prepare a plain text file (first column : residue numbers, second column : values to map)
and give the file's name as first argument to ProtSkin. Give the PDB file name as second argument.

2) You can use ProtSkin to read a BLAST, CLUSTAL or MSF alignment and create scripts to visualize residue conservation scores 
onto the structure. Scores correspond to conservation percentage of the corresponding residue in the alignment.
The BLAST alignment should be saved as "flat query anchored with letters for identities" into a file.
Use the -b option and give the file's name as first argument to ProtSkin. Give your PDB file name as second 
argument (if no PDB file name is provided here, conservation scores are calculated but no script is generated).
Insertions in the query sequence are discarded. Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.
To allow the script to check the residue correspondance between the query sequence and the PDB file, ensure that 
the number of the first residue of the query sequence in the BLAST file corresponds to its number in the PDB file.
Two types of conservations scores are generated simultaneously, corresponding to conservation to the query sequence 
or to conservation to the consensus sequence (the latter scripts start with the letter c for consensus).
	
        OPTIONS :
-b   Input is a BLAST, CLUSTAL or MSF file (otherwise, it is a plain list of scores as described above)
-u   Redundant sequences in the alignment are discarded.
-s   Similarity to the query sequence is calculated for the score (instead of identity).
-i   Invert colors (higher score = less color)
-1   Color is blue
-2   Color is green
-3   Color is cyan
-4   Color is red
-5   Color is magenta
-6   Color is yellow
-7   Color is orange

	EXAMPLES :
1) Map scalar data (in red) : 
ProtSkin -4 mydatafile mypdbfile

2) Map BLAST (or CLUSTAL or MSF) alignment discarding redundant sequences and coloring the less conserved residues (in orange).
ProtSkin -b -u -i -7 myblastfile mypdbfile
